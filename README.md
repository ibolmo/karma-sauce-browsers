# karma-sauce-browser-launcher

> Build a dictionary of browsers based on user input to be used in karma-sauce-launcher.

## Getting Started
This is a utility library for [karma-sauce-launcher](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-sauce-launcher).

Normally, you would need to define in your `Gruntfile.js` `customLaunchers` for each target. These `customLaunchers` are
too rigid and this library helps to build tasks that adds the `customLaunchers` programmatically.

## Testing

```shell
npm install -g mocha   # if necessary
mocha
```
